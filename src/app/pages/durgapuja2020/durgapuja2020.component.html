                <p >    
                  The puja is never the same without the sounds of “dhaak”, ulu dhwani, conches, the smell of incense and bhog. The sight of Maa Durga’s glorious ensemble, dhunuchi naach, sandhya arti, sandhi puja, mingling with friends is integral part of our experience.  This year has been challenging in many ways as most of our lives are disrupted by the global pandemic. In the midst of this ongoing calamity, we bring happy tidings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our goal is to provide you with the same feeling as previous years, but in a virtual setup. Maintaining the tradition and continuity we will be performing Durga Puja Online!
                    More details will be shared in the coming days.
