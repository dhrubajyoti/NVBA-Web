                Kobi Pronam is one of NVBA's signature celebration. Every year it is celebrated to observe the birth anniversaries of great Bengali poets, Rabi Thakur (25 e Baishakh) and Kazi Nazrul (May 24th). The patrons are encouraged to participate in the event with the celebration theme.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the wake of COVID-19 and resultant social isolation, we had to re-visualize our traditional 'Kobi Pronam' event. NVBA launches 'Kobi Pronam' on the evening of July 25th, 2020, at 8:00 PM.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will see the NVBA patrons performing and celebrating the birth anniversary of these two great poets. The prime time will have dances, songs, recitation, and much more. You will enjoy the extravaganza from the comfort of your couch. 
              </p>
              <p>  
                To enable you to enjoy the evening, we have arranged for a touchless dinner from a commercial restaurant. You can place your order below and relax and enjoy the evening.<span class="red">*</span>
